    <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY LOVE BUBU! 🎉🎂🎈💖</h1>
    
    <!-- Italicized, smaller font for this paragraph -->
    <p class="personalized-message">
        Today marks a day that is so incredibly special to me, because it's your birthday, and it's our first birthday together as a couple. 💖 Even though we are miles apart, my heart is right there with you, celebrating you in every way I can. I hope today brings you as much joy and happiness as you’ve brought into my life. 🌍
    </p>
    <p class="personalized-message">
        I love you more than words can ever express, and every day I find myself more grateful for the love we share. ❤️ You mean the world to me, and I want nothing more than to see you achieve everything you've dreamed of and more. The distance between us only makes my love for you grow stronger, and I know this love we have is unbreakable. 🔒💪
    </p>
    <p class="personalized-message">
        Though I can’t be there to hold you, I want you to know that every moment spent with you is a cherished memory. The bond we share is something I’ve never experienced before — it’s eternal, powerful, and nothing will ever stand in the way of it. This year, as we mark your special day, I’m reminded of how lucky I am to have you by my side, even if it's from afar. 💑✨
    </p>
    <p class="personalized-message">
        I hope this small gesture makes up for the distance, and you feel the depth of my love for you today and always. I’m counting down the days until I can hold you close and celebrate all the moments together that we deserve. 💞
    </p>
